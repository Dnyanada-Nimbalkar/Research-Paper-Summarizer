Research Paper Summarizer using Google Pegasus
Overview
This project aims to develop an automated summarization tool for research papers using Google's Pegasus model. The tool enables researchers to quickly grasp the key findings and insights from scientific literature, significantly enhancing the efficiency of literature review processes. It leverages the power of transformer-based models to generate high-quality abstractive summaries, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading research papers and accessing their summaries.

Features
Automated Summarization: Generate abstractive summaries of research papers using the Google Pegasus model.
User-Friendly Interface: Upload research papers in PDF format and receive concise summaries.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the quality of generated summaries using ROUGE metrics.
Efficient Workflow: Save time in understanding lengthy research documents.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Pip (Python package installer)
Git

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-summarizer.git
cd research-paper-summarizer

Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Google Pegasus Model
You need to download and set up the Google Pegasus model. Instructions for downloading the model can be found here.

Usage
Running the Application
To start the application, navigate to the project directory and run:
streamlit run app.py

This will launch the web application, where you can upload research papers and generate summaries.

Generating Summaries
Open the web application in your browser.
Click on the "Browse files" button to upload a PDF of the research paper.
Click on the "Summarize" button to generate the summary.
The summary will be displayed on the screen.
Evaluation
The quality of the generated summaries is evaluated using ROUGE metrics, which compare the generated summaries to reference summaries. The following table shows the ROUGE scores obtained during the evaluation:

Page Number	ROUGE-1	ROUGE-2	ROUGE-L
1	0.93	0.47	0.67
2	0.92	0.49	0.67
3	0.89	0.45	0.61
4	0.91	0.49	0.67
5	0.89	0.65	0.73
6	0.67	0.32	0.48
Future Scope
Multi-Language Support: Extend the tool to support summarization in multiple languages.
Improved Summarization Quality: Enhance the quality of summaries by fine-tuning the Pegasus model with a more extensive and diverse dataset.
Additional Features: Implement features like keyword extraction, topic modeling, and citation analysis to provide more insights into research papers.
